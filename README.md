Wissl Watch is a Chrome extension that detects **dog whistle language** ‚Äî subtle or coded phrases used to express harmful ideologies ‚Äî while you browse websites like Reddit, Twitter/X, or news articles.

It highlights flagged phrases with colors based on severity and explains why they might be dangerous, giving users the tools to better understand hidden biases in online language.

4. Flagged phrases are **highlighted** and explained via custom tooltips
